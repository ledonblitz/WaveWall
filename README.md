## Instructions

- Explore the wall's surface and observe the dynamic color bands.
- The irregular waves are generated using the `curveVertex` and `random` functions in P5.js.

## Technologies Used

- P5.js: A JavaScript library for creative coding and visualization. The dynamic color bands are achieved through P5.js functions and methods.

## Acknowledgments

- This project was created as a learning exercise.
- Inspiration for this project came from experimenting with P5.js and exploring creative coding concepts.
